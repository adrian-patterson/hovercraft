# hovercraft

### Summary <br/>
  This repository includes the Arduino C++ (.ino) file used to drive an autonomous hovercraft. The hovercraft consisted of two fans, three ultra-sonic sensors, and a servo. To get through an obstacle course, the arduino-based MCU used this code to decide where to maneuver based on ultra-sonic sensor data. Instad of hard-coding the course, our team decided on a dynamic algorithm that would continuously evaluate distances and decide accordingly.
  
### Result
  Though our testing was very successful, we did not complete the course on competition day. Our hovercraft made it two-thirds of the way through the course before failing to complete a turn. This error was the result of over-tweaking the code in a last ditch attempt to made it as speedy as possible. We ended up making the algorithm too aggressive and sensitive, causing over-turning. All in all, much was learned about validation and testing of models, and it was a great deal of fun. We made a smart hovercraft that was able to [autonomously drive!](pp)
